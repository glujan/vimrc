.vimrc
=====

Feel [free to use it](LICENSE) and [suggest](https://github.com/glujan/vimrc/issues/new) me some improvements if any. 
Keep in mind that I use it (mostly) for editing Python files.

Requirements
------------
- _Vim_ 7.3+ with Python support (check the latter with `vim --version | grep python`)
- `exuberant-ctags` system package for `taglist.vim` plugin

Usage
-----
- Clone this repo
- Copy or symlink my `.vimrc` into your home directory
- `git clone https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/vundle`
- `:BundleInstall` in _Vim_

To see how to manage plugins please refer to Vundle help (`:help vundle` in _Vim_).


Future
------

In a foreseeable future I would like to use _Vim_ also for editing JavaScript, CSS and HTML files. For now I am stuck 
with _Adobe Brackets_ ( :heart: ) for that.
